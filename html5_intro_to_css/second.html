        <h2>Eating Healthy and Being Active</h2>
        <h3>Is it really that important?</h3>
        <p>Just as with anyone, it's important to eat a healthy diet and be
            active to keep our bodies working well. This doesn't mean to go
            on a strict diet and work out for hours every day. However, one 
            should try to eat fruits and vegetables and limit the amount of 
            sugar they're eating. Also, getting some kind of physical activity
            is also important. Whether that's going on a run, taking a walk
            with friends, or even doing some strength training, working some 
            sort of physical activity into your day is a good thing. However,
            this doesn't mean that breaks aren't allowed. It's okay to skip
            your workout and have that piece of cake every now and then!
        </p>

        <h2>Some Misconceptions of Type One Diabetes</h2>
        <h3>The More You Know!</h3>
        <p>There are some misconceptions out there that people believe about
            type one diabetes. However, they aren't true. The linked article 
            above lists several. One, for example, is that people with this 
            condition developed it from eating too much sugar when that just
            isn't the case. You can't get this disease from eating too much sugar.
            Another is that type one can be cured; however, there currently is no 
            cure for this disease. Last, some people think that type one diabetics
            can't eat sugar. Again, this isn't the case. For me, I can eat whatever
            I like as long as I give the appropriate amount of insulin. So next time
            you see a type one diabetic eating a cookie or a piece of cake, don't tell
            them they can't have it. As long as they're doing as they should, it'll all
            be okay!
