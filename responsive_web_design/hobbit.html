                <h2>The Hobbit</h2>
                <p>The Hobbit trilogy is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
                    It begins sixty years before Frodo and the Fellowship begin
                    their journey. These movies follow Bilbo Baggins, a relative of
                    Frodo Baggins. These movies tell a story of adventure as well. They
                    show Bilbo joining a Company of Dwarves to help them regain their
                    home from the enourmous Dragon, Smaug. However, more danger awaits
                    them than just a dragon.</p>

                <h3>Another Heatbreaking End</h3>
                <p>What would these movies be without heartbreak? As the movies continue, 
                    Bilbo grows to care for the thirteen Dwarves he's traveling with.
                    However, three of his new friends don't make it out of the ending
                    battle alive. Bilbo, the Hobbit used to comfort and home, has 
                    seen death, and not just death, but the loss of good friends. He 
                    becomes a changed Hobbit after the adventure is over. Bilbo finally 
                    makes it back home, and the end of the movie jumps to present time when
                    The Lord of the Rings is beginning.</p>
