                <h2>J. R. R. Tolkien - The Genius Behind Middle Earth</h2>
                <p>If you've never seen The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit, first of all,
                    why haven't you? And second of all, you definitely should! Like right
                    now! Go now! These movies are absolutely amazing, but it wouldn't have 
                    been possible without the creative writing of J. R. R. Tolkien. This
                    brilliant man authored The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit.
                    Besides reading a bit from The Hobbit, I, myself, haven't read them.
                    Although, I absolutely would love to read them one day.</p>

                <h3>The One Ring</h3>
                <p>The One Ring plays a role in both sets of movies. In The Hobbit movies,
                    it sets up the larger role it plays in The Lord of the Rings. With this 
                    ring comes power but also darkness. A dark control is placed upon the 
                    one who has possession of it or sometimes one who wants possession of it. 
                    This is seen in several people, including Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins. 
                    If you have no clue what I'm talking about, that's all the more reason to
                    go watch these movies!</p>
