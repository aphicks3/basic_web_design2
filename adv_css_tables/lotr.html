                <h2>The Lord of the Rings</h2>
                <p>The Lord of the Rings films are beautiful films. They tell a
                    story of adventure. They show the duality of triumph and loss, of
                    love and heartbreak. The first movie opens in the Shire, home of
                    the Hobbits, where soon the young Frodo Baggins will go on a 
                    dangerous mission. Some notable characters of these films include
                    Frodo, Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn the Ranger, Gandalf the Grey,
                    Legolas Greenleaf, and many others. The first movie begins the 
                    Fellowship, consisting of four Hobbits, two Men, a Wizard, an Elf,
                    and a Dwarf.</p>

                <h3>The Triumphant, yet Heartbreaking End</h3>
                <p>The One Ring must be taken to Mordor, and Frodo and Sam make their way
                    to accomplish this dangerous and deadly mission. The two friends complete
                    the goal save Middle Earth from the evil Sauron. However, after going
                    through what they went through, it forever changed them. Frodo decides 
                    to leave his friends and the Shire and sail into the Grey Havens where
                    most, if not all, the Elves have gone. This heartbreaking decision was 
                    one Frodo believed he needed to make. At the end of the movie, Sam is seen
                    in the Shire with his wife and children, living a peaceful and happy life
                    now that the evil in Middle Earth has been vanquished.</p>
