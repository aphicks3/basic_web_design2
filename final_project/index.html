                <h2>Can Anyone Bake?</h2>
                <p>Some people may think that baking is too hard and that they'll
                    never be able to do it. However, if you can follow directions,
                    you can more than likely be a baker. Now, I'm not saying everyone
                    can do it alone. I've definitely had some help myself! Once you become
                    more comfortable with following a recipe, you can become more advanced
                    and get into more complicated recipes and possibly some complex
                    decorating. Baking, like most everything, takes practice. And practice, 
                    along with some knowledge, can turn beginners into professionals.</p>
